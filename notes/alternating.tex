\section{Standard generators for $A_n$}

Standard generators for $A_n$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $A_5$ \\
$a = (1,2)(3,4)$, $b = (1,3,5)$ \\
$a$ of order $2$, $b$ of order $3$ such that $ab$ has order $5$.
\item $A_6$ \\
$a = (1,2)(3,4)$, $b = (1, 2, 3, 6)(4, 5)$ \\
$a$ of order $2$, $b$ of order $4$ such that $ab$ has order $5$.
\item $A_n$, $n \geq 7$ odd \\
$a = (1, 2, 3)$, $b = (3, 4, 5, \ldots n)$ \\
$a$ is a $3$-cycle, $b$ is a $(n-2)$-cycle such that $ab$ has order $n$ (and $ab^2$ has order $15$ if $n = 15$)
\item $A_n$, $n \geq 8$ odd \\
$a = (1, 2, 3)$, $b = (2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots n)$ \\
$a$ is a $3$-cycle, $b$ is a $(n-1)$-cycle such that $ab$ has order $n-2$ and $[a,b]$ has order $2$.
\end{itemize}


\section{V2 standard generators for $S_n$}

The symmetric groups are $G.2$ for $G$ alternating, so we want standard
generators $a$, $b$, $r$ where $a$ and $b$ are the standard generators for $G$, $r$ acts
as an outer automorphism of order $2$.



\begin{itemize}
\item $S_5$ \\
$a = (1,2)(3,4)$, $b = (1,3,5)$, $r = (1,2)$ \\
$a$ of cycle type $2^2$ (or inner of order $2$), $b$ order $3$, $r$ a $2$-cycle such that $ab$ has order $5$, and $r$ takes $(a,b)$ to $(a,b^{abab})$. \\
\item $A_6$ \\
$a = (1,2)(3,4)$, $b = (1, 2, 3, 6)(4, 5)$, r = $(1, 2)$ \\
$a$ of cycle type $2^2$ (or inner of order $2$), $b$ of cycle type $(4)$ (or inner of order $4$), $r$ a $2$-cycle such that $ab$ has order $5$
and $r$ takes $(a,b)$ to $(a, b^{abbababbbabbab})$.
\end{itemize}
