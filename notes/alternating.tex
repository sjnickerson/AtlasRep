Standard generators for $A_n$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $A_5$ \\
$a = (1,2)(3,4)$, $b = (1,3,5)$ \\
$a$ of order $2$, $b$ of order $3$ such that $ab$ has order $5$.
\item $A_6$ \\
$a = (1,2)(3,4)$, $b = (2, 4, 5, 6)$ \\
$a$ of order $2$, $b$ of order $4$ such that $ab$ has order $5$.
\item $A_n$, $n \geq 7$ odd \\
$a = (1, 2, 3)$, $b = (3, 4, 5, \ldots n)$ \\
$a$ is a $3$-cycle, $b$ is a $(n-2)$-cycle such that $ab$ has order $n$ (and $ab^2$ has order $15$ if $n = 15$)
\item $A_n$, $n \geq 8$ odd \\
$a = (1, 2, 3)$, $b = (2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots n)$ \\
$a$ is a $3$-cycle, $b$ is a $(n-1)$-cycle such that $ab$ has order $n-2$ and $[a,b]$ has order $2$.
